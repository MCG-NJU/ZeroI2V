## Introduction

In this paper, we present a zero-cost adaptation paradigm (ZeroI2V) to transfer the image transformers to video recognition tasks (i.e., introduce zero extra cost to the adapted models during inference).

```
Our project is based on [MMAction2](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmaction2). Please refer to [install.md](https://mmaction2.readthedocs.io/en/1.x/get_started.html) for more detailed instructions.

## Data Preparation

All the datasets ([K400](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmaction2/blob/master/tools/data/kinetics/README.md), [SSv2](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmaction2/blob/master/tools/data/sthv2/README.md), [UCF101](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmaction2/blob/main/tools/data/ucf101/README.md) and [HMDB51](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmaction2/blob/main/tools/data/hmdb51/README.md)) used in this work are supported in [MMAction2](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmaction2).

## Training

The training configs of different experiments are provided in `configs/recognition/`. To run experiments, please use the following command. `PATH/TO/CONFIG` is the training config you want to use. The default training setting is 8GPU with a batchsize of 64.

```shell
bash tools/dist_train.sh <PATH/TO/CONFIG> <NUM_GPU>
```

We also provide a training script in `run_exp.sh`. You can simply change the training config to train different models.

## Evaluation

The code will do the evaluation after training. If you would like to evaluate a model only, please use the following command,

```shell
bash tools/dist_test.sh <PATH/TO/CONFIG> <CHECKPOINT_FILE> <NUM_GPU> --eval top_k_accuracy
```
## Reparameterize the linear adapter

Please refer to `tools\weight_reparam.py`.
## Test speed and throughput

Please refer to `tools\test_speed.py` and `tools\test_throughput.py`.
